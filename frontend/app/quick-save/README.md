# Quick Save Feature

The Quick Save feature allows users to quickly save links they find interesting with minimal effort. This is useful when you come across a website or article that you want to save for later reference without going through the full memo generation process.

## Features

- **Simple URL Entry**: Just paste the URL you want to save
- **Automatic Date Extraction**: The system attempts to extract the publication date from the URL or its content
- **Optional Notes**: Add quick notes or context about why you're saving the link
- **Categorization**: Assign a theme/category to organize your saved links

## How Date Extraction Works

The date extraction process follows these steps:

1. First, it tries to extract a date from the URL structure itself (e.g., `/2023/05/15/` or `?date=2023-05-15`)
2. If that fails, it sends the URL to the backend API which:
   - Checks for date patterns in meta tags (like `article:published_time`)
   - Looks for common date patterns in the page content (like "Published: May 15, 2023")
3. If all extraction methods fail, it defaults to the current date

## Implementation Details

- Frontend: React component with form validation and date picker
- Backend: Flask API endpoint that scrapes and analyzes web content
- Storage: Saved as a memo in Firebase with simplified fields

## Future Improvements

- Browser extension for one-click saving
- Batch import of multiple URLs
- Enhanced metadata extraction (author, title, summary)
- Improved date extraction accuracy
